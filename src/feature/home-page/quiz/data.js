        `Did you know we ‘catch’ emotions from other people — even when we’re not consciously paying attention?`,

        `Another word for this phenomenon is empathy and it tells us a lot about our relationships. Research suggests that a person’s happiness levels are related to the happiness of their friends. On the flip side, other emotions can also be spread through your social networks, such as fear, sadness, anger and disgust.`,

        `The good news is that emotional contagion is a skill you can work on by becoming aware of the emotions you exude and those of the people around you.`,

        `There’s a reason most car rental services won’t lease to anyone under age 25 — because research shows that our brains haven’t finished developing until our mid-twenties!`,

        `The prefrontal cortex — the bit that oversees impulse control and moderates social behaviour — is the last portion of the brain to fully form, which is why so many teenagers find themselves in tricky situations. Yet while 25 is the average age of development, this can vary for every individual. In fact, research shows that men’s brains develop an average of two years later than women!`,

        `Interestingly, the human brain begins to lose some memory abilities and other cognitive skills by your late 20s. Luckily, there are many ways you can keep your brain agile and healthy well into your later years.`,

        `A ticklish person will usually dread the moment someone lunges at their armpits, ribcage or feet with fingers poised for tickling. But that same ticklish person could poke themselves repeatedly in the same spots without so much as a giggle or a twitch. Why?`,

        `Essentially, our brains are always aware of what our bodies are doing at any given time. When you try to tickle yourself, your brain monitors the movement of your fingers and anticipates the sensations they will cause when you tickle yourself. It’s kind of like when your arms brush against your sides while you walk — your brain tells you not to notice it because you’re busy focusing on other things. But if someone was to brush past you in the same way, you immediately notice it because your brain wasn’t anticipating it.`,

  //       `The main cause of TBIs in Australia is falls — and not just in older people! Fall injuries account for about 40% of all hospitalised injuries and are the leading cause of injury deaths in Australia. Research shows that children are more likely to experience a TBI after falling from furniture, while young adults were more likely to get a TBI from collisions and pushes than other age groups.`,

        `Although speaking of ice-cream, are you ready for a mouthful? The medical name for a brain freeze is ‘sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia’ … so we’ll just keep calling it brain freeze.`,

        `Brain freeze occurs when you eat or drink something cold. The blood vessels and arteries in the roof of your mouth become chilled and constrict, then are quickly warmed up again once you open your mouth. This rapid change in temperature near the sensitive nerves that connect to your brain causes the sensation of brain freeze, giving you a headache-like feeling.`,

        `Luckily, brain freeze only lasts between a couple of seconds to two minutes and goes away on its own.`,

        `While many people use dementia interchangeably with Alzheimer’s Disease, they are two different things. Dementia isn’t one specific disease but rather a collection of symptoms that are caused by the deterioration of brain tissue. Therefore, Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia, along with 50 or so other disorders that affect the brain.`,

        `The most common symptoms of dementia are memory loss, confusion, personality changes and the loss of ability to perform everyday tasks. While dementia can happen to anyone, it is most common in people over the age of 65. Yet it’s important to remember that dementia is not a normal part of ageing, and a medical diagnosis should be obtained at an early stage when symptoms first appear.`
